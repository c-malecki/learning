# Learning Repository

**As a self taught developer who has spent his whole career (5+ years) in an early stage startup focused on fullstack web development**, I feel there are knowledge and skill gaps I haven't had the opportunity to fill. While I am on the job hunt, I have the time to spend in these areas that never came up in my previous job.

This repository will act as a reference for myself (and anyone else who may find it useful) and a way to give visibility into what I am currently learning and working on. I expect it will evolve and become more structured over time, acting somewhat like a blog, as well as a learning resource that will be more accomodating to others as opposed to just my own usage.

**Having worked with technologies like Golang, Vue3, React, TypeScript, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Docker, CSS/SCSS on a project that never scaled**, I am choosing to focus on 3 general areas currently:

1. Data Structures and Algorithms
2. Distributed Systems
3. Lower Level Programming

As someone without a formal education and never had practical application of DSA, I feel the best way for me to learn is to explore conceptual building blocks with both `Go` and `C`. In learning DSA, I will better understand the purpose for which modern technologies were created that are used in scaling web architecture through distributed systems.

## Golang

I am already proficient with `Go` and prefer statically typed languages. Although the standard lib already provides implementations for much of what I will be doing and there is a more idiomatic way to write `Go`, my objective isn't to write production code but to explore unfamiliar territory with a familiar language.

## C

What better way to get a firm grasp of the building blocks that stack up to create modern technologies and practices than to learn and use `C`? I'm sure there will be some redundancy between the `golang` and `c` directories, but it gives me a cross section of higher and lower order abstractions. Whether or not the lower level programming itself will translate directly into practical application in my next job, I just love to know how things work and wanted have a better understanding from the ground up.
